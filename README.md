# useImmerHook
 useImmer offers lots of tools compared to useState, I was able to mutate a draft copy of the state, use produce function from Immer which makes it convenient to making updates. It definitely makes the code a lot easier to read as a developer, their syntax are much easier to adapt to. So I find useImmer really efficient for when I want to manage different states in my project.
